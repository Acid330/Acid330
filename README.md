1. Write a program that changes the values of two integer variables a and b without use of additional variables.

2. Write a program that calculates and displays:

    * arithmetic mean of two integers a and b;
    * geometric mean of two integers a and b.

3. Write a program that rearranges the digits of the three-digit number that is specified user in reverse order and displays a new number on the screen.

4. Write a program that determines the total number of hours of the day (variable hour) and the total number of minutes of the day (variable minute) that have passed before the current seconds of the day (variable second). For example, if second = 11111 (second = 3 * 3600 + 5 * 60 + 11), then hour = 3 and minute = 5.

5. Write a program that determines the value of the angle in degrees (variable corner) between clockwise at the beginning of the day and its state in hour hours, minutes minutes and second seconds (0 ≤ hour ≤ 11; 0 ≤ minute; second ≤ 59).

6. Write a program that determines whether a natural number entered by the user:

    * even;
    * ending in the number 5.

7. Write a program that determines the value of an integer variable number - from 1 to 7, c depending on which day of the week (Monday to Sunday) is the day (whole variable day) of a low year, in which January 1 is Monday (1 ≤ day ≤ 365).

1. Write a Python program to generate and print a list, where the values are square of numbers between 1 and 30 (both included)
2. Write a Python program to display the examination schedule.
(extract the date from exam_st_date).
exam_st_date = (11, 12, 2014)
Sample Output : The examination will start from : 11 / 12 / 2014
3. Write a Python program which accepts a sequence of commaseparated numbers from user and generate a list and a tuple with those numbers.
Sample data : 3, 5, 7, 23
Output:
List : ['3', ' 5', ' 7', ' 23']
Tuple : ('3', ' 5', ' 7', ' 23')
4. Write a Python function that takes two lists and returns True if they have at least one common member.
5. Write a Python-script.
There is a bus moving in the city, and it takes and drop some people in each bus stop.

- You are provided with a list (or array) of integer arrays (or tuples). Each integer array has two items which represent number of people get into bus (The first item) and number of people get off the bus (The second item) in a bus stop.

- Your task is to return number of people who are still in the bus after the last bus station (after the last array). Even though it is the last bus stop, the bus is not empty and some people are still in the bus, and they are probably sleeping there :D

  * 'w3resource' Expected Result : 'w3ce'
  * 'w3' Expected Result : 'w3w3'
  * 'w' Expected Result : Empty String

3. Write a Python program to get a string from a given string where all occurrences of its first char have been changed to '$', except the first char itself.
* Sample String : 'restart' 
* Expected Result : 'resta$t' 

4. Write a Python function to reverses a string if it's length is a multiple of 4.

5. Write a Python program that accepts a comma separated sequence of words as input and prints the unique words in sorted form (alphanumerically).

<b>Task #1:</b>

Implement a script which receives a string and replaces all " symbols with ' and vise versa. The script should return modified string.

<b>Task #2:</b>
 
Write a script that checks whether a string is a palindrome or not.

Returns 'True' if it is palindrome, else 'False'.

To check your implementation you can use strings from here
 

The script has to ignore special characters, whitespaces and different cases

<b>Task #3:</b>

Implement a script which works the same as str.split

<b>Task #4:</b>

Implement a script which returns the longest word in the given string.

The word can contain any symbols except whitespaces (`,\n,\tand so on).

If there are multiple longest words in the string with a same length return the word that occurs first.

 <b>Task #5:</b>

For a positive integer n calculate the result value, which is equal to the sum of the odd numbers of n.

Example

n = 1234 result = 4

n = 246 result = 0
