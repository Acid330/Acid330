...x is odd
...x is a multiple of 20 (e.g., 20, 40, 60, ...)
Assume that zero is a positive number. Write an expression that computes whether...
...x and y are both positive
...x and y have the same sign (both are positive or both are negative)
...x and y have different signs (one is positive and one is negative)
Write an expression that computes whether...
...all three names (x, y, and z) are bound to equal values
...all three names (x, y, and z) are bound to different values (none the same)
...two variables store the same value, but the third one is different
 
<b>Task #2:</b>

1. Write a program that changes the values of two integer variables a and b without use of additional variables.

2. Write a program that calculates and displays:

    * arithmetic mean of two integers a and b;
    * geometric mean of two integers a and b.

3. Write a program that rearranges the digits of the three-digit number that is specified user in reverse order and displays a new number on the screen.

4. Write a program that determines the total number of hours of the day (variable hour) and the total number of minutes of the day (variable minute) that have passed before the current seconds of the day (variable second). For example, if second = 11111 (second = 3 * 3600 + 5 * 60 + 11), then hour = 3 and minute = 5.

5. Write a program that determines the value of the angle in degrees (variable corner) between clockwise at the beginning of the day and its state in hour hours, minutes minutes and second seconds (0 ≤ hour ≤ 11; 0 ≤ minute; second ≤ 59).

6. Write a program that determines whether a natural number entered by the user:

    * even;
    * ending in the number 5.

7. Write a program that determines the value of an integer variable number - from 1 to 7, c depending on which day of the week (Monday to Sunday) is the day (whole variable day) of a low year, in which January 1 is Monday (1 ≤ day ≤ 365).

1. Write a program that reads 4 numbers from the keyboard and displays most of them.

2. Determine the number of days in the year that the user enters. In a leap year - 366 days, while in a normal 365.

3. A triangle exists only when the sum of any two of its sides is greater than the third. Given: a, b, c are the sides of the assumed triangle. Write a program that will indicate whether such a triangle exists or not.

4. Display all numbers in the range 1 to 100 multiples of 7.

5. Calculate using a factorial cycle the number n

6. Display the hourglass, the maximum width of which is read from the keyboard (odd number). In the example, the width is 5.
``` py

1. Write a Python program to generate and print a list, where the values are square of numbers between 1 and 30 (both included)
2. Write a Python program to display the examination schedule.
(extract the date from exam_st_date).
exam_st_date = (11, 12, 2014)
Sample Output : The examination will start from : 11 / 12 / 2014
3. Write a Python program which accepts a sequence of commaseparated numbers from user and generate a list and a tuple with those numbers.
Sample data : 3, 5, 7, 23
Output:
List : ['3', ' 5', ' 7', ' 23']
Tuple : ('3', ' 5', ' 7', ' 23')
4. Write a Python function that takes two lists and returns True if they have at least one common member.
5. Write a Python-script.
There is a bus moving in the city, and it takes and drop some people in each bus stop.

- You are provided with a list (or array) of integer arrays (or tuples). Each integer array has two items which represent number of people get into bus (The first item) and number of people get off the bus (The second item) in a bus stop.

- Your task is to return number of people who are still in the bus after the last bus station (after the last array). Even though it is the last bus stop, the bus is not empty and some people are still in the bus, and they are probably sleeping there :D

1. Write a Python program to calculate the length of a string.

2. Write a Python program to get a string made of the first 2 and the last 2 chars from a given a string. If the string length is less than 2, return instead the empty string. 

Sample Strings:

'w3resource' Expected Result : 'w3ce'

'w3' Expected Result : 'w3w3'

'w' Expected Result : Empty String

3. Write a Python program to get a string from a given string where all occurrences of its first char have been changed to '$', except the first char itself. Sample String : 'restart' Expected Result : 'resta$t' 

4. Write a Python function to reverses a string if it's length is a multiple of 4.

5. Write a Python program that accepts a comma separated sequence of words as input and prints the unique words in sorted form (alphanumerically). Sample Words : red, white, black, red, green, black Expected Result : black, green, red, white,red
